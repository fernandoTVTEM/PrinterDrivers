<H3>Adding Printers on Large IP Networks</H3>
	 <P>If you are adding printers (or multi-function devices) across a router or gateway (not on your local network), identifying the printers through this utility might be difficult:</P>
	 <UL>
		<LI> Routers might not pass the printer's Hardware, MAC, or Station Address.</LI>
		<LI>If you have multiple new printers on the local network, using the default IP address (192.0.0.192) to identify a printer will not guarantee that the correct printer is selected. Check the <B>Hardware Address</B> to identify the correct printer.</LI>
	 </UL>
	 <P>To use this utility to set up a printer, proceed as follows:</P>
	 <OL>
		<LI>Do one of the following:
		  <UL>
			 <LI>Physically move the printer onto the local network of your computer, or</LI>
			 <LI>Use this utility on a computer connected to the local network of your printer.</LI>
		  </UL></LI>
		<LI> Identify the printer through this utility and configure IP parameters that match the printer's final network location. If you need to find out the MAC address, you can find it by printing a configuration (test) page (from either the printer or from the external print server) to make sure you are selecting the correct MAC or hardware address.</LI>
		<LI>If necessary, return the printer (or the HP Jetdirect external print server) to its final network location.</LI>
		<LI> To install this printer on other computers, do one of the following:
		  <UL>
			 <LI>For other computers or servers that will print directly to this printer, use this utility to configure each computer or server, or</LI>
			 <LI>For Windows clients that will print to this printer through a shared system, use the client system's Add Printer utility in the Printers folder, or use a shared printer installation program created for this printer.</LI>
		  </UL></LI>
	 </OL>
