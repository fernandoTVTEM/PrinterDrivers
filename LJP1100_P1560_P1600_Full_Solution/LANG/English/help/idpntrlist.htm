		<H3>Printers Found</font></H3>
		
<P>The 
		<B>Printers Found</B> screen allows you to select a printer discovered on the local network 
or to get additional setup options for installing network, USB, or parallel 
connected printers. </font></p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Install a 
			discovered network printer.</b> Select the desired printer from the 
			list of all the printers (or multi-function devices) discovered on 
			the local network and click <b>Next</b>. Click the <B>Search Again</B> 
			button to perform another search for printers on the network. </font>
			</li>
			<li><b>Help me find my 
			printer.</b> Select this option if your desired network printer is not listed 
			or you would like to install a printer that will be connected 
			directly to your computer using a <b>USB</b> or <b>parallel</b> 
			cable.&nbsp; For network printers, this option will provide 
			additional search options such as searching for a printer by IP 
			Address.&nbsp; </font></li>
		</ul>
	 <P><B>Note: </B>To set up printers that are not located on the local network, see <a href="addpntrslgIPntwks.htm">Adding Printers on Large IP Networks</A>.</font></P>
	 <P>Printers in the list are identified by the following fields. The Hardware Address might be the easiest way to identify the printer:</font></P>
	 <TABLE BORDER="1">
		<TR>
		  <TD VALIGN="TOP">Model</font></TD>
		  <TD> Identifies the printer model (for example, HP LaserJet 5000 Series). <B>Unknown</B> is displayed if the model could not be identified, the printer is turned off, or if there is no printer connected. For HP Jetdirect external print servers, the following is displayed if a printer is connected but could not be identified:<BR>
			 </font>
			 <UL>
				<LI>Parallel: Centronics Printer/Plotter</font></LI>
				<LI>USB (unidirectional): Unidirectional Peripheral</font></LI>
				<LI>USB (bidirectional): Bidirectional Peripheral</font></LI>
			 </UL></TD>
		</TR>
		<TR>
		  <TD VALIGN="TOP">Hardware Address</font></TD>
		  <TD> (also called a Station Address or MAC address). Uniquely identifies a device on the local network. For HP printers and HP Jetdirect external print servers that have multiple printer ports, a port number (Port 1, Port 2, Port 3) may be appended. This address is listed on the print server's configuration (test) page. 
			</font> </TD>
		</TR>
		<tr>
		  <TD VALIGN="TOP">IP Address<A HREF="glossary.htm#IP address"></A></font></TD>
		  <TD>(Internet Protocol) Uniquely identifies a device on a TCP/IP network and is assigned by a network administrator. 
            Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses will be shown in this list.&nbsp; If a printer 
            has multiple addresses, it will appear once for each address, allowing 
            you to select which interface to use.&nbsp;
			</font> 
			<p><span class="058515115-16062006">
<b>
			Note:</b> When an HP Jetdirect print server is powered on and is not 
			configured with a valid IP address within two minutes, either an 
			Auto-IP address&nbsp;(169.254.x.x) or a default IP address (192.0.0.192) 
			is automatically assigned.&nbsp;HP recommends the default IP address&nbsp;be 
			changed. If there are multiple printers with the same default 
			address, check the Hardware Address to identify the correct printer.<span class="610363223-15062006"></span></font></span></TD>
		</tr>
		<TR>
		  <TD VALIGN="TOP">IP Hostname</font></TD>
		  <TD>An IP hostname is a friendly (or easy-to-identify) name that can 
			be used in place of the printer's IP address. It can be used when a
			name server on the network has been set 
			up to map hostnames to their corresponding IP addresses. If a 
			hostname has been assigned and configured on the printer (for 
			example, <b>printer1.marketing.com</b>), you can specify the 
			hostname to identify the printer.</font></TD>

<P>For instructions on printing a network configuration page, see the documentation that came with the printer.</font></P>

	 <P>If a selected printer has been protected by an SNMP Community Name or Jetdirect password, you will be prompted for the Community Name or password.</font></P>
